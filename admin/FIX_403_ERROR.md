# 🔧 Fix 403 Error - Move Files from build/ to Root

## Current Problem:
```
public_html/build/  ← Files are nested here (WRONG)
```

## Solution:
```
public_html/        ← Files should be here (CORRECT)
```

---

## Step 1: Delete the build Folder

In File Manager:
1. Click on the `build` folder
2. Click delete/trash icon
3. Confirm deletion

---

## Step 2: Open Local build Folder

On your computer, navigate to:
`C:\Users\Laxus\Documents\I-Repair\i-repair\admin\build`

You should see these files:
- index.html
- manifest.json
- robots.txt
- asset-manifest.json
- favicon.ico
- logo192.png
- logo512.png
- .htaccess
- static/ (folder)
- assets/ (folder if present)

---

## Step 3: Upload CONTENTS (Not the Folder)

Option A - Upload Individual Items:
1. Select ALL files INSIDE the build folder
2. Drag and drop into public_html
3. Do NOT select the "build" folder itself

Option B - Upload Multiple Items:
1. Click "File" option in upload dialog
2. Select ALL files from build folder (not the build folder)
3. Upload
4. Then upload the static/ folder separately

---

## Step 4: Verify Structure

After upload, public_html should look like:
```
public_html/
├── index.html           ← Should be at root
├── manifest.json
├── robots.txt
├── asset-manifest.json
├── favicon.ico
├── logo192.png
├── logo512.png
├── .htaccess
└── static/             ← Folder at root level
    ├── css/
    ├── js/
    └── media/
```

NOT:
```
public_html/
└── build/              ← This should NOT exist
    └── (files)
```
