# 🎯 Final Upload Steps to Hostinger

## ✅ Build Completed Successfully!

Your admin app is built and ready at:
`C:\Users\Laxus\Documents\I-Repair\i-repair\admin\build`

---

## Step 1: Delete Old Files from Hostinger

In Hostinger File Manager (`public_html`):
1. Delete the `build` folder
2. Delete `default.php` if it exists
3. Delete any other default files

You should have an **empty** `public_html` folder

---

## Step 2: Upload CORRECT Build Files

Navigate to your local folder:
```
C:\Users\Laxus\Documents\I-Repair\i-repair\admin\build
```

### Files to Upload (from admin/build/):

1. **index.html** (1 KB)
2. **manifest.json** (1 KB)
3. **robots.txt** (1 KB)
4. **asset-manifest.json** (1 KB)
5. **favicon.ico** (4 KB)
6. **logo192.png** (6 KB)
7. **logo512.png** (10 KB)
8. **.htaccess** (1 KB) ← Important!
9. **static/** folder (entire folder with CSS & JS)
10. **assets/** folder (entire folder with images)

---

## Step 3: Upload Method

In Hostinger File Manager:

**Option A: Upload All at Once**
- Click "Upload" button
- Choose "Folder"
- Select the entire `build` folder from: `i-repair/admin/build`
- This will upload everything including folders

**Option B: Upload Piece by Piece**
- Click "Upload" → "File"
- Select these files one by one:
  - index.html
  - manifest.json
  - robots.txt
  - asset-manifest.json
  - favicon.ico
  - logo192.png
  - logo512.png
  - .htaccess (from i-repair/admin/public/)

- Then click "Folder"
- Upload `static` folder
- Upload `assets` folder

---

## Step 4: Verify Structure

After upload, `public_html` should have:
```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── manifest.json
├── robots.txt
├── asset-manifest.json
├── favicon.ico
├── logo192.png
├── logo512.png
├── .htaccess          ← Must be here!
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   └── js/
└── assets/
    └── images/
```

**Important:** Files should be in root of `public_html`, NOT in a subfolder!

---

## Step 5: Add Domain to Firebase

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **i-repair-laxus**
3. **Authentication** → **Settings**
4. **Authorized domains** → **Add domain**
5. Add: `irepair.space`
6. Add: `www.irepair.space`

---
