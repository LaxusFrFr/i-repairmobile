# ✅ CORRECT Upload Steps for Hostinger

## ❌ What NOT to Do:
- Don't click "File" and upload individual files
- You'll miss the `static/` folder
- Website won't load

## ✅ What TO Do:

### Step 1: Cancel Current Upload
- Click "Cancel" on the upload dialog

### Step 2: Click "Folder" Option
- Click the "Folder" button in the upload dialog

### Step 3: Select Your Build Folder
- Navigate to: `C:\Users\Laxus\Documents\I-Repair\i-repair\admin\build`
- Select the ENTIRE `build` folder
- This uploads everything including the `static/` folder

### Step 4: Upload
- Click "Open" or "Upload"
- Wait for all files to upload

## Why Choose "Folder"?

When you upload the entire `build` folder, you get:
- ✅ All individual files (index.html, manifest.json, etc.)
- ✅ The `static/` folder with CSS and JS
- ✅ The `assets/` folder
- ✅ Everything in one go

This ensures your website will work!

Your `public_html` should contain:

├── favicon.ico
