# Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Install Firebase CLI

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

**Wait for it to finish** (takes about 1-2 minutes)

## Step 2: Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

This will open a browser window. Sign in with your Google account that has access to Firebase.

## Step 3: Navigate to Project

```bash
cd C:\Users\Laxus\Documents\I-Repair\i-repair
```

## Step 4: Initialize Firebase Functions

```bash
firebase init functions
```

**When prompted, select:**
- âœ… Use an existing project
- âœ… Select "i-repair-laxus"
- âœ… Language: TypeScript
- âœ… ESLint: Yes
- âœ… Install dependencies: Yes

Wait for it to finish.

## Step 5: Navigate to Functions Directory

```bash
cd functions
```

## Step 6: Install Function Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Wait for it to finish.

## Step 7: Build Functions

```bash
npm run build
```

You should see "Build succeeded"

## Step 8: Go Back to Root

```bash
cd ..
```

## Step 9: Deploy Functions

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**This takes about 2-3 minutes**

You'll see:
```
âœ”  functions[createUser(us-central1)]: Successful update operation.
âœ”  functions[createTechnician(us-central1)]: Successful update operation.
```

## âœ… DONE!

Now test creating a user - it should work without logout! ðŸŽ‰

## If You Get Errors

**"firebase is not recognized"**
â†’ Run: `npm install -g firebase-tools` and restart terminal

**"Not logged in"**
â†’ Run: `firebase login` again

**"Project not found"**
â†’ Make sure you selected "i-repair-laxus" in step 4

**"Build failed"**
â†’ Check the error, usually missing dependencies. Run `npm install` again.

**"Permission denied"**
â†’ Make sure your Google account has access to the Firebase project

## After Deployment

Your functions are now live! You can:
1. âœ… Create users without logout
2. âœ… Create technicians without logout
3. âœ… Deploy to Hostinger
4. âœ… Everything works seamlessly
